# InsightCV Backend
Welcome to the backend repository of InsightCV, a comprehensive resume analysis tool designed to provide insightful evaluations of resumes.

This backend is built using FastAPI and integrates various machine learning models to assess and score resumes effectively.

## Features

- Resume Upload: Securely upload resumes in various formats.​
- Resume Analysis: Utilizes language models to extract and evaluate key information from resumes.​
- Scoring System: Implements algorithms to score resumes based on predefined criteria.​
- API Endpoints: Provides RESTful API endpoints for interacting with the frontend and other services.​

## Project Structure
The backend is organized as follows:​

```bash
Backend/
├── __pycache__/         # Compiled Python files
├── llm_models/          # Directory for language model implementations
├── resume_scores/       # Contains scoring algorithms and related scripts
├── routers/             # API route definitions
├── uploaded/resumes/    # Directory where uploaded resumes are stored
├── .env                 # Environment variables configuration
├── .gitignore           # Git ignore file
├── database.py          # Database connection and models
├── main.py              # Entry point of the FastAPI application
├── models.py            # ORM models for the database
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
└── resume_analyzer.db   # SQLite database file
```
## Installation

Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandreddy05/InsightCV.git
cd InsightCV/Backend
```

Create a Virtual Environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'

Install Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set Up Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the Backend directory and add the necessary configuration variables as specified in .env.example.

Initialize the Database:

Ensure that the resume_analyzer.db SQLite database is set up and migrated. You can use Alembic for managing database migrations.

Run the Application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

For a detailed list of all endpoints and their usage, refer to the API documentation generated by FastAPI's automatic interactive docs at /docs.
